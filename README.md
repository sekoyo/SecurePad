SecurePad
=========

SecurePad can be used to securely encrypt your documents.

SecurePad can be used, among other things for:

- Encrypting files on your hard drive with information like passwords, bank details, and other sensitive information.

- Sending sensitive information across the internet such as through email.

SecurePad uses a powerful and secure cryption algorithm (, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)), though of course it is always advised that you use a reasonably complex password. It also means you should be careful because there is no way to recover your information if you forget the key you used!
